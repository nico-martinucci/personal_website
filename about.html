        <div id="about_me">
            <p>originally from berkeley, ca, i found my way to seattle, wa in 2008 to attend the university of
                washington. after learning about the world of urban planning my senior year of high school and a chance
                conversation with a near-stranger, i discovered the
                <a href="https://cep.be.uw.edu/" target="_blank">community, environment & planning program (cep)</a>.
                after only a few quarters of dull, 300+ person lectures with no direct participation, cep felt like a
                breath of fresh air: small class-sizes, student-led governance, and most importantly the closest thing
                uw had to a major in urban planning. the program also allowed for immense flexibility in how each
                student designed their education, allowing me to double-major in sociology and pair the technical,
                often policy-oriented world of urban planning with a burgeoning interest in social justice and building
                more equitable cities.
            </p>
            <p>after graduating in 2012, i kicked-off what would end up being a decade-long career in planning and
                public service. beginning even before then, i accepted a job with the us department of housing and
                urban development's (hud)
                <a href="https://www.hud.gov/fairhousing" target="_blank">office of fair housing and equal
                    opportunity</a>
                as an equal opportunity specialist, determining jurisdictional compliance with federal fair housing
                requirements and
                investigating direct complaints of housing discrimination, based on complainants race, disability,
                familial status, and more.
            </p>
            <p>my time at hud solidified two main things for me: 1) the importance of baking equity into the work we (both
                planners and just generally socially-conscious people) do every day, and 2) that the enormous scope of
                hud's work - and the even larger bureaucracy designed to do it - didn't mesh with my desire to see more
                direct and immedaite benefits of my efforts. reflecting these realizations, in 2014 i made the decision
                to go back to school at uw for my 
                <a href="https://urbdp.be.uw.edu/programs/mup-graduate-degree/" target="_blank">masters of urban planning</a>, 
                with the ultimate goal of narrowing the
                focus of my work significantly, focusing on effecting more localized equity and livability improvements
                for seattle specifically.
            </p>
            <p>again, before i was even done with school, i took the next step in my professional career and begin a
                job with the <a href="https://www.seattle.gov/transportation" target="_blank">seattle department of transportation (sdot)</a> 
                to improve the city's transit system. a key
                tool for improving equitable outcomes (in this case that of mobility and access to opportunity), transit
                became a key focus of mine and its potential for transformative change drove me to pursue successive
                positions with higher levels of potential impact and improvement. in the seven years i worked at sdot i
                officially held nine different positions, and worked my way up to managing a team of planners, social
                workers, and policy experts to deliver the voter-approved 
                <a href="https://www.seattle.gov/transportation/projects-and-programs/programs/transit-program/proposition-1" target="_blank">seattle transit measure</a> 
                (with a budget of
                over $50m per year)and meet many of the personal and professional goals that i had acquired.
            </p>
            <p>in 2022, after two years of back-breaking work to improve transit in a world that no longer seemed to
                value it as it once had, i decided that a change was needed. having always been interested in computers,
                in my sudden spare time granted to me by the COVID-19 pandemic, i began to teach myself coding
                (primarily through <a href="https://phaser.io/" target="_blank">phaser.js</a>, a light-weight video game development engine), and fell in love. wanting
                to steer my new-found interest in a more pragmatic direction, i began to research software engineering
                bootcamps, which brought me to rithm, and the rest is history.
